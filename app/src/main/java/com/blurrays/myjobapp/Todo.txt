#Authentication & accounts (Rated by most important to least)
- Password reset
- Account verification by email or sms
- external accounts (Google, Facebook, etc)
- Profile page (might use settings)

#Optimization & error handling
- Make unit tests
- Make integration tests
- Lessen Firestore usage by passing classes with the intent.
- Return to specific fragment when returning to main activity
